			<about>
				 ESPNcricinfo (formerly CricInfo) is a sports news website exclusively for the game of cricket. 
				 The site features news, articles, live coverage of cricket matches (including liveblogs and scorecards), 
				 and StatsGuru, a database of historical matches and players from the 18th century to the present. 
				 It is edited by Sambit Bal.\n
				 The site, originally conceived in a pre-World Wide Web form in 1993 by Dr Simon King, 
				 was acquired in 2002 by the Wisden Group—publishers of several notable Cricket magazines and 
				 the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. As part of an eventual breakup of the Wisden Group, it was sold to ESPN, 
				 jointly owned by The Walt Disney Company and Hearst Corporation, in 2007.
